Approximating a complicated function by piecewise functions is an alternative to reduce complexity. 
%Clearly, provided that the number of pieces is kept to a minimum. 
This is a common approach in optimization to create tractable versions of originally hard to solve problems.
%
In this line, the most ordinary approach is to build \glsfirst{PWL} functions, where in each interval a linear function is used to represent the original function. 
%
When the original function is well defined (with known derivatives), or at least has a mathematical description, many algorithms exist to find the appropriate breakpoints that define the intervals, and to designate their linear app
